# Munchkin Card Creator

Create high-quality custom cards for the [Munchkin](https://munchkin.game/) card game!

For example:

(This program is not official nor officially associated with Steve Jackson Games' Munchkin)

## Start

### Online

I will eventually try to make a GitHub Pages site to skip the downloading process, but for now:

### Local

Download and unzip this repository and save it to a location of your choice on your computer.

Open the file `index.html` in a browser, e.g. Google Chrome (I recommend using Google Chrome as the browser because it was made and tested in Chrome and may be a little wonky in other browsers).

## Use

You can see a preview of your card on the left. If the preview does not refresh automatically, you can use the refresh button (ðŸ—˜) at the bottom.

The topmost button switches between door cards and treasure cards. If the card preview does not switch to the correct background after you clicked on this button, just click on the refresh button.

Hopefully, the text fields are self-explaining. Note that linebreaks (by the Enter key) are only supported in the main text fields (*Text* and *Bad Stuff*). If you want a linebreak in any of the fields *Name*, *[Modify Monster]* or *[Change Level]*, you can type a *#* where a linebreak should be inserted. The other fields do not allow linebreaks.

With the 'Choose File' button, you can select an image from your files to use on your card. The three fields below can be used to change the position and scaling of the image.

## Save/Load

If you want to save your card, click on the save button (ðŸ“¥) below the card preview. This will save the card as `.png` and `.html` file in your "Downloads" folder. If you do not specify a filename in the text field right left of the save button, the filename will be created from the card's name.

If you want to continue working on a card, open the saved `.html` file. This will redirect you to the Munchkin Card Creator and insert all the parameters of your card, except the image. You have to load the image again, but position and scaling are saved from the last time.

## Example

You can find an example for a custom treasure card (*Donut Chicken*) in `example`. You can load and edit the card by opening `Donut Chicken.html` and loading the image `Donut Chicken Art.png` again.
